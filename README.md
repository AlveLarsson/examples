# smoke-tests [WIP]
A collection of frameworks used as a suite of smoke-tests for tauri

## Basic Tests
The `todomvc` folder is composed of baseline apps from the [todomvc](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc) projects. At the moment we're building:
 - angular2
 - polymer
 - react
 - vanillajs

They have not been modified in any way.

## vanillajs/monolith
This is a hand-made monolithic html file. It should be good to just drop in. Soon we'll have a webpack and babel approach to do this as well.
