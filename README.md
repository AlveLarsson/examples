# smoke-tests [WIP]
A collection of frameworks used as a suite of smoke-tests for tauri

## Basic Tests
The `todomvc` folder is composed of baseline apps from the [todomvc](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc) projects. At the moment we're building:
 - angular2
 - polymer
 - react
 - typescript-backbone 
 - vanillajs

They have not been modified in any way.
