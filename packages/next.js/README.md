**Proton** brings a mode to build Quasar Apps that creates tiny, blazing  <img align="right" src="https://cdn.quasar.dev/logo/proton/proton-logo-240x240.png">
fast binaries for all major desktop platforms. In Quasar's 
[neverending quest](https://quasar.dev/introduction-to-quasar#Why-Quasar%3F) 
for performance and security, the core team is proud to offer an
alternative to Electron.

Whether you are just starting out making apps for your meetup or 
regularly crunch terabyte datasets, we are absolutely confident that 
you will love using Proton as much as we love making and maintaining it.

It leverages Cocoa/WebKit on macOS, gtk-webkit2 on Linux and MSHTML
(IE10/11) or Webkit via Edge on Windows. **Proton** is based on the 
MIT licensed prior work known as [webview](https://github.com/zserge/webview).
The default binding to the underlying webview library uses Rust, but 
other languages are possible (and only a PR away).

### Current Status
We are in the process of vetting this new mode. It is not yet available to
use without jumping through some development hurdles. If you don't care,
please reach out to the team at https://chat.quasar.dev and we'll guide
you through the process.

## Relation to Upstream Origins
We have made the decision to fork, enhance and maintain several upstream
projects here in this repository, in order to guarantee the security of the
code and our ability to enhance it with features that may not be needed for
other consumers.

We hope that this code is useful, but make no claims to suitability or 
guarantees that it will work outside of the Quasar ecosystem.

This has been done with our best attempt at due diligence and in
respect of the original authors. Thankyou - this project would never have
been possible without your amazing contribution to open-source and we are
honoured to carry the torch further. Of special note:
- [zserge](https://github.com/zserge) for the original webview approach
- [Boscop](https://github.com/Boscop) for the Rust Bindings
